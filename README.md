# glfw3Learning

This project is meant to teach me everything about graphics & c++ I need to know.

If you ever wanted to do what I did:
* create a Project using Xcode
* followed https://learnopengl.com/ to render a triangle
* found out: you can make the background transparent!?
* read about OpenGl/GL/GLFW
* played around with shaders
* read vertex & fragment shader from file
* import fbx files ( choose assimp )
* used glm to rotate object
* using the depth buffer
